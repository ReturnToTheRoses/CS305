# CS305
I’ve shared a screenshot of the /checksum endpoint’s JSON response showing my own string (“Frogg: Hello World Check Sum!”) and its SHA-256 hash as the main proof of work. Artemis Financial is a company that builds custom money-management plans, and they needed every file transfer on their website to be encrypted and tamper-proof. To do this, I turned on HTTPS in the Spring Boot app (so all traffic on port 8443 is encrypted) and added a new /checksum route that takes any text and returns its SHA-256 checksum. This way, data is both sent securely and checked for changes.

The hardest part was creating and pointing to the Java keystore, but once that was set up I visited https://localhost:8443/checksum in my browser and saw the secure padlock plus the JSON output. Next, I ran a dependency checker tool to make sure I hadn’t accidentally introduced new security holes. In the future, I’d plug these checks into an automated build so they run every time I update code. For anyone who might hire me, I’d show how neatly the checksum logic fits into ChecksumController, how I set up HTTPS, the screenshot of the secure browser view, and the clean scan report, proof that I can find risks and lock them down.
